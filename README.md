What is Project Managment?
Project management is the process of accomplishing a predefined goal within a set time period and budget. It requires a varied group of techniques, skills, and tools.

During the project management cycle, we’ll create and implement a plan for our project. We’ll track progress throughout. In some cases, we’ll have to make changes to cope with unplanned situations and events. If that happens, we’ll need to reallocate resources to critical activities and tasks in order to stay on schedule; in a worst-case scenario, we may have to alter our project plan.

In a perfect world, we could deliver project results on time, on budget and with the right quality. In real life, we need to balance scheduling, budgeting and quality during the entire process.
